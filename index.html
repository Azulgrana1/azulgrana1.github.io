<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am a PhD student in ECE at Cornell University, advised by Professor Jayadev Acharya. My research interest broadly lies in distributed machine learning theory. My recent focus is distributed statistic estimation with information restrictions, such as differential privacy and communication constraints.
</p>
<p>Prior coming to Cornell, I graduated from the department of automation at Tsinghua University with honor, advised by Yipeng Li. I also worked with Prof. Liwei Wang from Peking University. In addition, I worked as research intern in Microsoft Research Asia and Face++.
